# rigidity_masters
Code for my master's project on rigid frameworks.

All code used in the project is here in one form or another. It is exceedingly messy at the moment but all of the actual functions are in framework.py and a mostly operational example would be reducedtesting.py or maybe GFpapertesting.py.

All the animations and figures used are here too, either in the root directory or in FINISHED_ANIMATIONS/.

There are many miscellaneous files that found their way into the repo and will be removed in due course.
